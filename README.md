# Machine Learning CPP and Python

This project is a research-oriented tool for studying and experimenting with **machine learning classifiers**.
The core is implemented in **C++**, exposed as an **API** that can be easily integrated with other languages such as **Python, Go, Zig**, and more.

## Objectives

* Provide a simple way to test machine learning algorithms in both **C++** and **Python**.
* Start with implementations of **classifiers** and **ensembles**, then expand towards **data stream mining**.
* Build a modular API that allows integration with different programming languages.
* Follow an approach inspired by the [MOA (Massive Online Analysis)](https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) project, but with a C++ core for efficiency and extensibility.

## Motivation

The main motivation of this project is to create a **research tool** that:

* Facilitates experimentation with machine learning algorithms.
* Bridges the gap between high-performance **C++ implementations** and the flexibility of **Python scripting**.
* Serves as a foundation to learn, compare, and extend algorithms for both static and streaming data.
